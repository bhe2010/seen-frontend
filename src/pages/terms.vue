            AAA is not permitted to accept any arbitration demand without this certification.<br />
            (B) Except that either party may file a complaint in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional
            limits that apply, any controversy or claim between the parties or arising out of these Terms or any use of
            the Service shall be determined by one disinterested arbitrator in binding arbitration pursuant to the
            Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). For more information
            including how you can file for arbitration, visit www.adr.org/. Testimony shall be permitted by telephone,
            video conference and other forms of real-time telecommunications or, at your election, arbitration can be
            decided on a documents-only basis. If the arbitrator requires in-person hearings, the hearings shall be held
            in New York, New York or within the state and county where you reside. Except for demands that are dismissed
            summarily, where the pre-dispute process describedin (A) above has not been followed, or where a demand is
            determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous or brought in bad faith, we agree to pay your filingfees in
            connection with arbitration. The arbitral award will be final and binding, and may be entered and enforced
            inany court of competent jurisdiction.<br />
            (C) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL AND CLASS ACTIONS BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND SEEN ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
            TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT, TO RECEIVE A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A
            PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLAIM ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE
            CAPACITY. YOU AND SEEN BOTH AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A
            PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND
            YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION SUIT AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO
            PROCEED WITH AN ARBITRATION ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE
            RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE
            RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.<br />
            (D) IF FOR ANY REASON THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS IS DEEMED INAPPLICABLE OR INVALID, OR
            TO THE EXTENT THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE ALLOWS FOR LITIGATION OF DISPUTES IN COURT, YOU AND SEEN BOTH WAIVE, TO
            THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER

          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and interpreting
            case law. Where state law applies, the laws of New York, United States, will apply without regard to its
            conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
            considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable
            by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
            agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had
            between us regarding the Service.

            If any provision of these Terms, or any part of such provision, is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
            that provision will be (to the minimum extent necessary) replaced by a valid and enforceable provision the
            effect ofwhich comes as close as possible to the intended economic effect of the unenforceable or invalid
            provision, so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable, provided
            however that the provision in Section 20(c) shall take precedence over this provision when interpreting
            Section 20.
